    Integrate VOSpace and Rucio

    Need a Rucio deployment to work with.
        Find an Ansible or Helm deployment to use.
        Install on [Eleanor|IRIS|...].

    I understand what VOSpace does.
    I don't understand much about the SSO standards.
        Learn from Sara's work on SSO integration.

    I don't understand much about Rucio.
        Local deployment(s) to experiment with.


    What I do know
        Rucio is simlar to iRODs
        Declarative system, describe what you want, the system figures out how.
        Internally, Rucio uses FileTransferService to actually move the data.
        This sounds like an equivalent level to VOSpace.

    Initial guess

        Integrate VOSpace as a component in Rucio.
            Mapping the VOSpace space into Rucio space.
            Transfer agent, equivalent to a FileTransferService.

        Integrate Rucio as a component in VOSpace.
            Mapping the Rucio space as a VOSpace node.
            Translating the VOSpace transfers to Rucio rules.

        To run a VOSpace we will need a registry.
        RegistryInaBox - RiB
            Based on Gregory's TAP service, HSQLDB or Derby, and some tweaks.


    VOSpace client
        Python client library, useable by other projects.
            VOSpace client needs a Registry client ..
                Registry client needs a TAP client ..
        How much is already in pyvo/astropy ?
            Not much at all.



    Use case targets :

        VOSpace|Rucio

            Make data in VOSpace appear to be part of Rucio space.
